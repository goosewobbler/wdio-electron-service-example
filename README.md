# wdio-electron-service-example

Minimal electron app providing a working example of testing using [`@wdio/electron-service`](https://github.com/webdriverio/desktop-mobile-testing).

This project is simply a clone of the E2Es and one of the example apps from the [`webdriverio desktop & mobile testing`](https://github.com/webdriverio/desktop-mobile-testing) repo, and is intended to be used for manual testing / release verification of `@wdio/electron-service`.

## Building the app and running the tests

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm run ci
```
